Previously Doctoral Researcher @ <a href= 'https://genomics.ut.ee/en'>Institute of Genomics</a>, Tartu, Estonia


Passionate biologist with a strong background in genetics. From my early days as a student scientist, I've always been drawn to the thrill of discovery. I embarked on a quest for knowledge, which led me to earn my Ph.D. in Genetics and uncover the mysteries of Human Evolutionary Genetics.

I have always been dedicated to science outreach, I believe that effective science communication is a powerful tool for inspiring curiosity and promoting informed decision-making. Along with being a teacher assistant in the science communication course at University of Tartu, I wrote extensively about genetics on different platforms (see the ScienceOutreach page if you're curious!)
