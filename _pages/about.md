Previously Doctoral Researcher @ <a href= 'https://genomics.ut.ee/en'>Institute of Genomics</a>, Tartu, Estonia

Passionate academic achiever and versatile professional ready to bridge the gap between academia and industry.
From my early days as a student scientist, I've always been drawn to the thrill of discovery. I embarked on a quest for knowledge, which led me to earn my Ph.D. in Genetics and uncover the mysteries of Human Evolutionary Genetics. Now, I'm ready to take those discoveries beyond the lab and into the dynamic world of private enterprises. My academic background has honed my analytical thinking, complex problem solving, research, and data analysis skills, which are invaluable in addressing complex challenges in the corporate world. I am excited to explore opportunities in the private sector where I can leverage my academic expertise to drive innovation and contribute to the success of dynamic organizations. In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm an avid problem solver and lifelong learner who is always eager to take on new challenges. When I'm not decoding the mysteries of 0s and 1s on my screen, you'll find me climbing boulders, hunting for vintage sewing machines, or... probably coding some more.

So, what happens when academia meets industry, and innovation becomes the bridge between the two? Join me on this exhilarating journey to find out!
