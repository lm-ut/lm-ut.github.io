Previously Doctoral Researcher @ <a href= 'https://genomics.ut.ee/en'>Institute of Genomics</a>, Tartu, Estonia


Passionate biologist with a strong background in genetics. From my early days as a student scientist, I've always been drawn to the thrill of discovery. I embarked on a quest for knowledge, which led me to earn my Ph.D. in Genetics and uncover the mysteries of Human Evolutionary Genetics. My background in research has sharpened my analytical thinking, complex problem solving, research, and data analysis skills, which are invaluable in addressing complex challenges in the corporate world. I am excited to explore opportunities in the private sector where I can leverage my academic expertise to drive innovation and contribute to the success of dynamic organizations. I'm an avid problem solver and lifelong learner who is always eager to take on new challenges. When I'm not decoding the mysteries of 0s and 1s on my screen, you'll find me climbing boulders, hunting for vintage sewing machines, or... probably coding some more.

I have always been dedicated to science outreach, I believe that effective science communication is a powerful tool for inspiring curiosity and promoting informed decision-making. Along with being a teacher in the science communication course at University of Tartu, I wrote extensively about genetics on different platforms (see the ScienceOutreach page if you're curious!)
