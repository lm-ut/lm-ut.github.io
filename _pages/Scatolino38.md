DNA is not made up of just genes. On the contrary, only 1-2% of your DNA comprises genes. Almost every one of your cells contains about two meters of thighly packed deoxyribonucleic acid.
However, only a very small portion of this DNA contains the essential information for the functioning of your cells.
Furthermore, a significant portion of this information is shared with other organisms. For example, 80% of mouse genes perform the same functions as ours, and we share over 96% of our genes with chimpanzees. ..Well, do you think we are so different from an onion?
If you feel offended, don't blame me; it's all evolution's doing, I swear! Evolution has preserved many genes because they serve essential functions. 
Consider how many different organisms are required to produce molecules like hemoglobin or enzymes for digesting carbohydrates.
However,to compare genes, we can only find macro-differences between species. For details, we need to look at the remaining 98% of DNA, where there aren't any genes.
If genes make up only 2% of DNA, what makes up the rest?
