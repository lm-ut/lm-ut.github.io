Almost 5,300 years ago, high in the mountains, a man of about 45 years old was hit at the back of his head, fatally, by an arrow. Covered in snow and ice, he remained hidden from most people for millennia, until, in 1991, two hikers noticed the body near the Tisenjoch pass, in the Ötztal Alps, also called Ötztal. The remains are still preserved in the Museum of Anthropology in Bolzano; this is where 'Ötzi,' or 'The Iceman,' [3] can be found. Ötzi has lived all his life in South Tyrol, yet genetically he is closely related to the Sardinians. How can it be? DNA contamination? Some distracted scientist? No, this result has perfect sense...
