If you believe that you have the most eccentric relatives in your family tree, starting tomorrow, you can easily (or more precisely, scientifically) include Charlemagne as well!

Consider your family tree: it starts with you at generation zero
(0). In the previous generation (generation 1), you have your two parents. The generation before that, your four grandparents make up generation 2. Every generation we find 2^K relatives,where k is the generation number that we are considering. Let's begin with us as the only protagonists (2^0=1), then there are our two parents (2^1 =2), and then the grandparents (2^2 =4). How many direct ancestors did we have 20 generations ago? 1,048,576. And 30 generations ago? Over a billion direct ancestors. And at Charlemagne time? To go back to the 19th century we need about 40 generations, and 2^40 ago ... 1,099,511,627,776 (I dare you to read it!).

Leaving aside the logistical challenge of organizing lunch for Christmas, there's a significant issue with this vast number of relative. In the 19th century, the world's population was far from reaching one billion inhabitants. So, it raises a question: How is it possible that each of us had billions of relatives 1200 years ago when, in the year 1000 AD, there were only a few million inhabitants?
