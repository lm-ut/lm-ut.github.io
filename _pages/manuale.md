The Manual of Anthropology, Evolution and Human biodiversity is a cutting-edge manual of over 600 pages that covers a broad spectrum of advanced concepts in the field of Anthropology and Evolution. In particular, several italian renown scientists took part in writing sections of the manual, sharing their expertise. I took part in wroting section focused on human evolutionary genetics: about 10 pages explaining in a clear on concise manner the peopling of continents and human diversity (Capitolo 6.4 'Il popolamento dei continenti e le mappe della diversit√† umana'), joint work with Prof. Pagani (University of Padua).
