We all have incredible stories within our DNA, and studying them has been proven incredibly helpful. Since the advent of ancient DNA, we started to rethink our ancestors, their cultures, their ability to move and expand to other lands, their links with other communities: we, humans, have not changed that much. And if you’re not an eager traveler, or your passions are more futuristic than mine (You’re allowed – I don’t judge), I’ll tell you this: many people have been misdiagnosed of certain diseases because many genome-wide association studies, in which geneticists look for any variant or mutations that could be associated with a trait or a disease, are based on analyses of people with a “European story” (European descent), and so the results are biased toward one ancestry. The stories within us are important, for our curiosity, but also for so much more.
