African populations from Ethiopia admixed with individuals arriving from Eurasia
3000 years ago, and from that moment, the Horn of Africa carried a signature of
this encounter. There have been several attempts to pin-point the Eurasian source
in Ethiopia, some of them used modern genomes, while others used ancient
samples: the Non African layer was deemed to be from Sardinia by Pickrell in 2014
and from the Levant by Lazaridis in 2016. However, past studies analyzed the whole
genome globally, both African and Eurasian layers altogether. In this thesis, using
several populations, both modern and ancient as references, and the Ethiopian and
Egyptian populations published by Pagani 2015, it was possible to study more in
depth the backflow into Africa through a method called Ancestry Deconvolution.
With this approach the Ethiopian genomes were divided in their two layers, and the
two ancestral components that characterize the Horn of Africa could be analyzed
specifically: the African and the Non African components. This novel approach shed
light on new aspects of this area demographic history while confirming others:
notably, the Africa component is confirmed being prevalently East African, while
the Non African component shows strong similarities with Anatolia Neolithic and
Minoan samples.
