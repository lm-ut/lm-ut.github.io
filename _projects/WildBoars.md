The wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) arrived in Sardinia with the first human settlers in the early Neolithic with the potential to hybridize with the domestic pig (S. s. domesticus) throughout its evolution on the island. In this paper, we investigated the possible microevolutionary effects of such introgressive hybridization on the present wild boar population, comparing Sardinian wild specimens with several commercial pig breeds and Sardinian local pigs, along with a putatively unadmixed wild boar population from Central Italy, all genotyped with a medium density SNP chip. We first aimed at identifying hybrids in the population using different approaches, then examined genomic regions enriched for domestic alleles in the hybrid group, and finally we applied two methods to find regions under positive selection to possibly highlight instances of domestic adaptive introgression into a wild population. We found three hybrids within the Sardinian sample (3.1% out of the whole dataset). We reported 11 significant windows under positive selection with a method that looks for overly differentiated loci in the target population, compared with other two populations. We also identified 82 genomic regions with signs of selection in the domestic pig but not in the wild boar, two of which overlapped with genomic regions enriched for domestic alleles in the hybrid pool. Genes in these regions can be linked with reproductive success. Given our results, domestic introgression does not seem to be pervasive in the Sardinian wild boar. Nevertheless, we suggest monitoring the possible spread of advantageous domestic alleles in the coming years.
