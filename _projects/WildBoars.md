The wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) arrived in Sardinia with the first human settlers in the early Neolithic. In this paper, we investigated the possible microevolutionary effects of the introgressive hybridization with domestic pig on the wild boar population, comparing Sardinian wild specimens with several commercial pig breeds and Sardinian local pigs, along with a putatively unadmixed wild boar population from Central Italy, all genotyped with a medium density SNP chip. 

Modelling the Sardinian boars as a mixture of a boar-like ancestry and a pig-like ancestry, we found three hybrids within the Sardinian boar samples. The hybridization event was dated through MALDER around 20 generation ago (100 years ago).

Local Ancestry Deconvolution analyses on the three hybrids revealed non-uniform levels of domestic pig introgression: ranging from 10% to 26.6%. Nonetheless, chromosomes 4, 7, 13, and 14 were the most affected, while chromosome 18 the least. We then looked for signatures of selection, comparing the results with the LAI assignment. PBS identified 11 genomic regions differentiated in the hybrids, however, none of those were in common with the domestic regions found by ELAI. .
