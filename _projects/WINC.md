Contemporary individuals are the combination of genetic fragments inherited from ancestors belonging to multiple populations, as
the result of migration and admixture. Isolating and characterizing these layers are crucial to the understanding of the genetic history
of a given population. Ancestry deconvolution approaches make use of a large amount of source individuals, therefore constraining
the performance of Local Ancestry Inferences when only few genomes are available from a given population. Here we present WINC,
a local ancestry framework derived from the combination of ChromoPainter and NNLS approaches, as a method to retrieve local
genetic assignments when only a few reference individuals are available. The framework is aided by a score assignment based on
source differentiation to maximize the amount of sequences retrieved and is capable of retrieving accurate ancestry assignments
when only two individuals for source populations are used.
